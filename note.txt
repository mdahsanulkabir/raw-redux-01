Middleware 
    - is the suggested way to extend Redux with custom functionality
    - it provides a third-party extension point between dispatching an action, and the moment it reaches the reducer
    - it is used for loggin, crash reporting, performing asynchronous tasks etc


example of middleware - redux-logger
