Middleware 
    - is the suggested way to extend Redux with custom functionality
    - it provides a third-party extension point between dispatching an action, and the moment it reaches the reducer
    - it is used for loggin, crash reporting, performing asynchronous tasks etc


example of middleware - redux-logger



actions 
Synchronous action
asynchronous actions - for example may require API calls




state
state = {
    loading: true,
    data : [],
    error: ''
}

actions
FETCH_USERS_REQUEST - fetch list of actionsFETCH_USERS_REQUEST
case : FETCH_USERS_REQUEST
    loading : true

FETCH_USERS_SUCCESS
case: FETCH_USERS_SUCCESS
    loading : false
    users : data(from API)

FETCH_USERS_ERROR
    loading : false
    error : error (from API)



Async action creator
install axios
install redux-thunk


redux-thunk : it provides the ability of action creator to return a function instead of an action object
